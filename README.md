# Comparing Machine Learning Models

The included Jupyter notebook contains the code and resulting output for testing three models with the World Health Organization's data from
2018 concerning various countries' life ladder scores. The models tested are:

+ Linear regression
+ Neural network
+ Stacked regression model

The metrics used to determine the quality of each model determine that, given this set of data, the ensemble model works best, with an r^2 value of about 0.9.
